#CoinWiki

This was a collaborative effort between my classmates and myself. We were seperated into groups and my group and I worked effortlessly on our own version of all you can think of Crypto gathering information! Our CoinWiki site consists of JS, HTML, CSS, and utilized Materialize as our API. We have spent a considerable amount of time on this with future additions to our project that will be added. One of those additions will be trading crypto.
